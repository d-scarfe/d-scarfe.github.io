    <description><![CDATA[In this article, we&rsquo;re going to build a simple REST API in Scala using the Play Framework.
We shall utilise HTTP requests to perform basic CRUD operations on an example dataset.
We&rsquo;ll demonstrate (in Scala) how we can serve our content back to the user in the JSON format.
This tutorial shall provide the basis from which we can build efficient, scalable backend systems.
Introducing the Play Framework Why choose Play?]]></description>
